Removed PDB IDs from the benchmark (with brief reasons):
- 1SX6 – multiple ligands/sugars; ambiguous placement
- 7W9A – duplicated ligand copies; ambiguous mapping
- 1LFO – multiple lipids; inconsistent ligand selection
- 1YIV – extra small molecule; lipid placement unreliable
- 4TKB – primary DAO vs extra P6G; ambiguous ligand choice
- 1G74 – RDKit failure (invalid valence in predicted ligand)
- 1VYF – RDKit failure (unknown element in predicted ligand)
- 2LKK – RDKit failure (unknown element in predicted ligand)
- 5B27 – RDKit failure (unknown element in predicted ligand)
- 7FW5 – RDKit failure (unknown element in predicted ligand)
- 7NSR – RDKit failure (unknown element in predicted ligand)
