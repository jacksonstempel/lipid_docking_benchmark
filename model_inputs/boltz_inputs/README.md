## Boltz Inputs (Curated Benchmark)

This folder contains the **Boltz input YAML files** for the curated benchmark entry list
in `scripts/pairs_curated.csv`.

### What’s Included

- One file per target: `model_inputs/boltz_inputs/<PDBID>.yaml`

### Scope / Curation

- This directory is intentionally kept in sync with the benchmark’s curated target list.
- If a PDB ID is removed from the benchmark, its YAML is removed here as well.
- If a PDB ID is added to the benchmark, a matching YAML should be added here.
